## TMDb API Token
To compile app you have to add your own TMDb API Token.

Go to `[USER_HOME]/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
If you do not have `gradle.properties` file, you have to create one.

Then add the following line:
```
TMDbApiToken="token"
```

If you have an account on TMDb the token can be obtained [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
